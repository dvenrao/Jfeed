It's not hard to imagine the examples: a rural farmer has a cousin in the city who drives an auto-rickshaw. The cousin
talks to his boss who needs another driver and hires the farmer. Or a nanny works for a rich family when another rich
family needs a cook. So the nanny recommends her sister, who is hired and thereby increases her income by 100%.

These dependencies on word-of-mouth networks create huge inefficiencies both for employers and job seekers - e.g.
there is no job bulletin board in villages 60kms outside of major cities like Bangalore providing comparative
listings of every security guard job in the city. Which jobs pay Rs5000/$90 versus Rs7000/$120 month and which
need Hindi versus English speaking guards? Similarly, there's no digital way that a security guard agency -
which may hire hundreds of people each month - can easily filter and reach out to their ideal candidates.

JobTar acts as a scalable, sustainable, digital and replicable solution to both informal sector employers and
job seekers. Our interviews have shown that hired job seekers on average report income increases of 20.1% and average
decreases of 14 minutes per day in commute times. We have extensively studied the blue-collar employment process in India
and created innovative mechanisms whereby users can register themselves on their mobiles or experienced users can register others.

Poor families everywhere often fall into poverty when major health calamities occur – if a father and primary income earner
is a day laborer and loses a hand, his family may often fall destitute (It should be noted that the solution to sudden calamity
found in many developed nations is also simple – insurance).

On the positive side, the study showed that poor families often left the poverty trap through income diversification i.e.
they got other jobs. If a farmer started fixing tractors on the side or a young son got a better paying job in the city,
eventually that extra income really did raise the real economic status of the family. How were these jobs obtained?  Well,
the employee knew someone who knew someone.

Sean’s first thought was “Great – all they need is the village version LinkedIn.com!” but obviously in order to make such
  a system work, one has to overcome the problem that most low-income workers of the world may not be literate, nor own a
  mobile phone and rarely own or have ready access to an Internet-connected PC.
</p><p>
Thus, Jobtar was born as an experiment by Sean, his step-father Ira Weise and Microsoft collegaue Vibhore Goyal, to leverage
  the web, the mobile and social networks to accelerate the escape from poverty. It is an experiment – a possible solution to
  provide all levels of job seekers more with job opportunities while efficiently helping employers find suitable employees.
